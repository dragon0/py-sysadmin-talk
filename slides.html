# A Brief History of UNIX Scripting

---

## Bash/Pipes

Bash is the standard shell on most UNIX-based systems (Linux, MacOS, etc).
The user can type the name of a program and Bash will execute it.
Programs can accept additional options on the command line.
Programs have "standard" text streams, one for data input, one for data output, and one for error output.
The standard output of one command can be redirected to the standard input of another command.
This allows the user to create "pipelines" for processing text.

This system encouraged the creation of many small programs to "do one thing well" so they could be combined in pipelines.
One such program is `grep`, which prints lines that match a regular expression pattern.

`grep '\<c...h\>' /usr/share/dict/words`

---

## Sed

Sed is the stream editor.
Given editing commands on the command line, it reads standard input, performs the editing commands, ant writes the result to standard output.
The most common command is `substitute` (abbr. `s`),
which performs a regular expression find-and-replace.

`cat /etc/passwd | sed 's/^\([^:]*\):.*:\([^:]*\)$/\1 uses shell \2\t(&)/'`

---

## Awk

Named after the creators: Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.
Awk creates a C-like programming language for processing text.
Awk reads standard input and separates it into records and fields.
For each record, it then executes the script, supplying the fields using numbered variables.

`df -h | awk '/dev\/hd/ { print $6 "\t: " $5 }'`

TODO the problem with special-purpose languages and switch to general-purpose languages

---

## Perl

---

## Typical Perl code

```perl
@P=split//,".URRUU\c8R";@d=split//,"\nrekcah xinU / lreP rehtona tsuJ";sub p{
@p{"r$p","u$p"}=(P,P);pipe"r$p","u$p";++$p;($q*=2)+=$f=!fork;map{$P=$P[$f^ord
($p{$_})&6];$p{$_}=/ ^$P/ix?$P:close$_}keys%p}p;p;p;p;p;map{$p{$_}=~/^[P.]/&&
close$_}%p;wait until$?;map{/^r/&&<$_>}%p;$_=$d[$q];sleep rand(2)if/\S/;print
```

# Installing Python

---

## Installing on Windows

Official website: https://www.python.org/

Anaconda (recommended): https://www.anaconda.com/

During install, look for and enable the option `Add Python to System PATH`.

If using Anaconda, after install, create a shortcut to launch IDLE:
1. Open the install folder (probably `C:\Anaconda`)
2. Right-click on `pythonw.exe`
    - Select `Send To` > `Desktop (Create Shortcut)`
3. Right-click on the shortcut and select `Properties`
    1. Go to the shortcut tab
    2. Add ` -m idlelib` to the end of Target
        - It should look something like `"C:\...\pythonw.exe" -m idlelib`

---

## Installing on Linux or MacOS

You probably already have Python installed.
Try opening a Terminal and type `python3`.
You should see a message like `Python 3. ...` followed by a prompt `>>> `.
Press `CTRL-D` to close it.

Also check that you have IDLE.
In the terminal, run `idle3`.
On some Linux distros, IDLE might be a separate package.
Install it with something like `apt install idle3`.
This will also add a launcher icon to your application menu.

On MacOS, if you want a launcher icon, you must download Python from https://www.python.org/ and install it.
This means you may have two different versions of Python installed.
This shouldn't be an issue.

# Basics

---

## A Basic Python Script

```python
print('Hello, world!')
*name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello", name)
```

---

## Using the Python Shell

```python
$ python3
Python 3.4.3 (default, Nov 28 2017, 16:41:13) 
[GCC 4.8.4] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> x = 4
>>> x = 'hi'
>>> x
'hi'
>>> x.upper()
'HI'
>>> x = 4
>>> x.upper()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'upper'
>>> x = 'hi'
>>> type(x)
<class 'str'>
>>> dir(x)
[...]
>>> help(x.upper)
```

---

## Base Types

- int
- float
- str

---

## String Literals

```python
>>> "the quote doesn't need to be escaped"
"the quote doesn't need to be escaped"
>>> 'The "quotes" do not need to be escaped'
'The "quotes" do not need to be escaped'
>>> 'when there\'s more than "one", use \\'
'when there\'s more than "one", use \\'
>>> '''
... adf
... '''
'\nadf\n'

```

TODO raw strings

---

## Docstrings

TODO

---

## Booleans

```python
>>> True
True
>>> False
False
>>> None
>>> print(None)
None
```

---

## If Statements

```python
if condition:
    pass
elif condition:
    pass
else:
    pass
```

---

## While Statements

```python
while condition:
    pass
```

---

## Lists

TODO

---

## Tuples

TODO

---

## Functions

```python
def function(args):

## Making a Script Executable

`chmod +x`

`$ which python3`

`#!/usr/bin/python3`

`#!/usr/bin/env python3`

---

## Docstrings and Doctest

---

## Basic Script

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# import statements

# function definitions

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # main/script code, or
    import doctest
    doctest.testmod()
